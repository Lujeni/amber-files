## Amber files ðŸ¦Š

I created this project because I needed a quick and easy way to test my Neovim setup with various programming languages.
Instead of always diving into real projects, I wanted a set of scripts that cover all the basics and some advanced stuff.
This way, I can see how my editor handles everything from syntax highlighting to autocompletion.

### What's Inside

- **Handy scripts** that show off a bunch of features in different programming languages:
  - **Python**
  - **Lua**
  - **Elixir**
  - **Bash**
  - **Go**
  - **HTML/JS**

- **Examples include**: basic syntax, data structures, functions, classes, modules, file I/O, exceptions, and type hints.

- Perfect for checking out how Neovim (or any editor) deals with code in these languages!

### How to Use

1. **Clone this repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lujeni/amber-files.git
    cd amber-files
    ```

2. **Go** in the language of your choice:
    ```bash
    # For Python
    cd python/example-01/
    ```

3. **Check out your editor** to see all the cool highlights and autocompletes.

### More Languages Coming Soon!

Iâ€™m planning to add more languages (mostly based on my usage), so keep an eye out.
Got suggestions? Open an issue or throw in a pull request. Letâ€™s make this awesome together!

### Have Fun!

This is just a little something to make setting up your editor a breeze. Hope it helps you as much as itâ€™s helped me!

Hope this project can help other people too!

Happy coding! ðŸ¦Š
